### about this project:
This project was created just to showcase my HTML and CSS skills. Some of the approaches of this project are hard-coded, such as sliders and togglers, etc., which are created with the features available in CSS. If you want to use this template, it is suggested to use programming languages such as JavaScript. It is also recommended to use the Chrome browser for a better experience.
